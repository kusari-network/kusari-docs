# <b>CLAIMS</b>

The Kusari network is SwapDex's experimental, community-focused research & development network. If you held the SDX ERC-20 token or SDX coins at the time of the genesis block of Kusari, you are entitled to claim an equivalent amount of KSI on the Kusari network.

You can claim KSI by creating a ticket on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Cs6CmpKH).

!!! hint
    **The deadline for claimable KSI based on SDX holdings is Friday, December 3rd 2021**
